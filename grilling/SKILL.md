## WorkBuddy 适配说明

移植自 [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) 的 `productivity/` 分类（MIT）。原文方法内容未改，仅以下三点适配：

1. **子代理映射**：WorkBuddy 的 Agent 工具支持 `subagent_type` 为 `Explore`（只读代码探索）与 `general-purpose`（多步执行）。文中 subagent 一律按此映射，其余约定照原文执行。
2. **可被模型触发**：上游未标记 `disable-model-invocation`，模型可按 description 主动选用。
3. **Issue tracker**：多个技能假设存在 issue tracker（Linear 等）。没有 tracker 时，把 ticket / spec / 决策记录落到仓库内 `docs/` 下的 Markdown 文件即可，流程不变。
Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
